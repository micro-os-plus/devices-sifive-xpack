# A source code library with the ÂµOS++ SiFive device specific files

This project provides support for SiFive RISC-V microcontrollers.

The project is hosted on GitHub as
[micro-os-plus/devices-sifive-xpack](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/devices-sifive-xpack).

## Maintainer info

This page is addressed to developers who plan to include this source
library into their own projects.

For maintainer info, please see the
[README-MAINTAINER](README-MAINTAINER.md) file.

## Install

As a source library xPack, the easiest way to add it to a project is via
**xpm**, but it can also be used as any Git project, for example as a submodule.

### Prerequisites

A recent [xpm](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/),
which is a portable [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) command line application.

It is recommended to update to the latest version with:

```sh
npm install --global xpm@latest
```

For details please follow the instructions in the
[xPack install](https://xpack.github.io/install/) page.

### xpm

Note: the package will be available from npmjs.com at a later date.

For now, it can be installed from GitHub:

```sh
cd my-project
xpm init # Unless a package.json is already present

xpm install github:micro-os-plus/devices-sifive-xpack
```

When ready, this package will be available as
[`@xpack-sifive/devices`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xpack-sifive/devices)
from the `npmjs.com` registry:

```sh
cd my-project
xpm init # Unless a package.json is already present

xpm install @xpack-sifive/devices@latest

ls -l xpacks/xpack-sifive-devices
```

### Git submodule

If, for any reason, **xpm** is not available, the next recommended
solution is to link it as a Git submodule below an `xpacks` folder.

```sh
cd my-project
git init # Unless already a Git project
mkdir -p xpacks

git submodule add https://github.com/micro-os-plus/devices-sifive-xpack.git \
  xpacks/@micro-os-plus/devices-sifive
```

## Branches

Apart from the unused `master` branch, there are two active branches:

- `xpack`, with the latest stable version (default)
- `xpack-develop`, with the current development version

All development is done in the `xpack-develop` branch, and contributions via
Pull Requests should be directed to this branch.

When new releases are published, the `xpack-develop` branch is merged
into `xpack`.

## Developer info

TBD

### Status

The **devices-sifive-** source library is fully functional; for now it supports 3 of the initial SiFive devices, FE310, E31Arty
and E51Arty.

### Build & integration info

To include this package in a project, consider the following details.

#### Source files

The source files to be added to user projects are:

TODO

#### Include folders

The following folders should be passed to the compiler during the build:

- `include`

The standard way to include the device files is

```c
#include <micro-os-plus/device.h>
```

#### Preprocessor definitions

- `SIFIVE_FE310`
- `SIFIVE_E31ARTY`
- `SIFIVE_E51ARTY`

#### Compiler options

- `-std=c++20` or higher for C++ sources
- `-std=c11` for C sources

#### C++ Namespaces

TBD

#### C++ Classes

TBD

### Examples

TBD

### Known problems

- the `os_terminate()` function is not fully implemented, it must
use either the Watchdog or PMU+RTC to trigger a system reset.

### Tests

TBD
